# BSAG Public Operations Briefing MCP Server

TypeScript MCP server for BSAG operations briefings. It combines public VBN GTFS-Realtime, BSAG/VBN notice pages, VMZ Bremen traffic information, and Bremen event listings into five explainable tools:

- `get_line_health`
- `get_external_impacts`
- `get_service_notices`
- `build_shift_brief`
- `draft_passenger_information`

Every tool returns a full structured envelope with `status: "complete" | "partial"`, source freshness, explicit citations, and warnings when a public source is stale, unavailable, or only partially parsed.

## Requirements

- Node 22
- npm
- Optional: Docker

## Install and build

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Run over stdio

```bash
cp .env.example .env
node --env-file=.env dist/transports/stdio.js
```

Example client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bsag-briefing": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/BSAG-MCP/dist/transports/stdio.js"],
      "env": { "BSAG_MCP_DATA_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/data" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run over Streamable HTTP

Loopback-only startup:

```bash
node --env-file=.env dist/transports/http.js
```

Non-loopback startup requires a bearer token:

```bash
HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 HTTP_PORT=3000 HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN=change-me node --env-file=.env dist/transports/http.js
```

HTTP rules:

- loopback hosts (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`) can run without a bearer token
- non-loopback hosts must set `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN`
- requests with an `Origin` header are rejected unless the exact origin or hostname matches the configured allowlist
- `/health/live` returns process liveness
- `/health/ready` returns database readiness

## Environment variables

Key runtime variables:

- `BSAG_MCP_DATA_DIR`: writable directory for SQLite storage; the server stores `bsag.sqlite` inside it
- `CORRIDORS_PATH`: corridor mapping JSON, default packaged `config/corridors.json` beside the installed binaries
- `LINE_ROUTE_MAP_PATH`: public line label to GTFS route ID mapping JSON, default packaged `config/line-route-map.json`
- `HTTP_HOST`: bind host for HTTP mode, default `127.0.0.1`
- `HTTP_PORT`: bind port for HTTP mode, default `3000`
- `PORT`: fallback bind port when `HTTP_PORT` is unset; used by Cloud Run
- `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN`: required when `HTTP_HOST` is not loopback
- `HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: comma-separated allowed exact origins or hostnames
- `RETENTION_DAYS`: SQLite retention for realtime snapshots, default `30`
- `REALTIME_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: GTFS-Realtime reuse window, default `300`

The server does not auto-load `.env`; use Node's `--env-file` flag or export variables in the shell.

Public source URLs are also configurable; see [.env.example](.env.example).

The Bremen events source uses the public `login.bremen.de` event-search API via
`curl --http1.1` because the HTML calendar page is Cloudflare-challenged for
Node HTTP clients. The Docker image installs `curl`; non-Docker hosts should
provide it on `PATH`.

## Corridor editing

Corridors are editable in [config/corridors.json](config/corridors.json). The file maps public line IDs and conservative place-name aliases. It does not claim geometric route overlap.

Line route mappings are editable in [config/line-route-map.json](config/line-route-map.json). The file translates public labels such as `6` or `10` to the static GTFS route IDs used by the VBN GTFS-Realtime feed. Direct GTFS route IDs are still accepted.

## SQLite retention

Realtime snapshots are stored in SQLite. Old snapshots are pruned according to `RETENTION_DAYS`. Service notices and external impacts are replaced per source refresh and reused as stale cache when a refresh fails.

## Tool examples and test prompts

The examples below are phrased as natural-language prompts for an MCP-capable
assistant, followed by the tool payload that should be sent. The Bremen details
were selected from public web sources checked on 2026-06-22, so refresh the
dates if the upstream notices have expired:

- BSAG [Linien- und Fahrpläne](https://www.bsag.de/fahrplan/linien-und-fahrplaene)
  and [Tagesnetz PDF](https://www.bsag.de/fileadmin/user_upload/26-04-13_Tagesnetz_WEB_.pdf)
  for Bremen line and stop names such as Hauptbahnhof, Domsheide, Flughafen,
  Universität-Nord, Gröpelingen, and Sebaldsbrück
- VBN
  [Verkehrshinweise für den Bus- und Straßenbahnverkehr](https://www.vbn.de/vbn/verkehrshinweise/bus-und-strassenbahnverkehr)
  for current public construction and diversion notices
- VMZ Bremen [Baustellen aktuell](https://vmz.bremen.de/baustellen/aktuell)
  and [RSS traffic feed](https://vmz.bremen.de/verkehrslage/aktuell/feed.rss)
  for roadwork and traffic-impact checks
- Bremen.de
  [Veranstaltungskalender](https://www.bremen.de/kultur/veranstaltungen) and
  [Veranstaltungs-Highlights](https://www.bremen.de/kultur/veranstaltungen/highlights)
  for event-driven checks

The bundled route map translates common BSAG public line labels to the static
GTFS `routeId` values used by VBN GTFS-Realtime. If a caller supplies an
unmapped public label, the tool returns `ROUTE_MAPPING_UNAVAILABLE` instead of
inferring a disruption or a clean line. Direct GTFS route IDs are still accepted.

### `get_line_health`

1. Prompt: Check current realtime health for BSAG lines 6 and 10;

   ```json
   { "line_ids": ["6", "10"] }
   ```

2. Prompt: Compare the central Bremen tram lines visible around Hauptbahnhof
   and Domsheide on the BSAG Tagesnetz: 1, 4, 6, and 8.

   ```json
   { "line_ids": ["1", "4", "6", "8"] }
   ```

3. Prompt: Look up the stored morning baseline for line 20 on 2026-06-21 at
   08:00 Berlin time, because VBN lists Steffensweg works affecting line 20.

   ```json
   { "line_ids": ["20"], "at_time": "2026-06-21T08:00:00+02:00" }
   ```

### `get_external_impacts`

1. Prompt: Check the west corridor on 2026-06-19, including Alte Waller Straße and Waller See, for current VMZ roadworks

   ```json
   { "corridors": ["west"], "date_from": "2026-06-19", "date_to": "2026-06-19" }
   ```

2. Prompt: For 2026-06-21, list external VMZ and event impacts on the east
   corridor around Steubenstraße, Vahrer Straße, and Hastedter Heerstraße.

   ```json
   { "corridors": ["east"], "date_from": "2026-06-21", "date_to": "2026-06-21" }
   ```

### `get_service_notices`

1. Prompt: Show notices since 2026-06-15 for BSAG lines 1 and N1; VBN lists
   night replacement buses for track works between Kurt-Huber-Straße and
   Nußhorn.

   ```json
   { "line_ids": ["1", "N1"], "since": "2026-06-15T00:00:00+02:00" }
   ```

2. Prompt: Find notices touching Universität-Nord and Bf Sebaldsbrück, two
   stop names present in the BSAG network material and current VBN notices.

   ```json
   {
     "stop_names": ["Universität-Nord", "Bf Sebaldsbrück"],
     "since": "2026-04-01T00:00:00+02:00"
   }
   ```

### `build_shift_brief`

These briefs always combine VBN GTFS-Realtime, BSAG/VBN notices, and
corridor-matched external impacts. Setting `include_comms_draft` requests
passenger drafts for high-risk lines; it does not guarantee that drafts will be
returned.

1. Prompt: Build the east-corridor morning brief for 2026-06-22 with comms
   drafts enabled, focusing on realtime, BSAG/VBN notices, and the
   Steubenstraße, Vahrer Straße, and Hastedter Heerstraße VMZ works.

   ```json
   {
     "date": "2026-06-22",
     "corridors": ["east"],
     "include_comms_draft": true
   }
   ```

2. Prompt: Build the west-corridor shift brief for 2026-06-22 without comms
   drafts, checking realtime, BSAG/VBN notices, Walle and Gröpelingen impacts,
   and VBN's Steffensweg line-20 notice.

   ```json
   {
     "date": "2026-06-22",
     "corridors": ["west"],
     "include_comms_draft": false
   }
   ```

3. Prompt: Build a central and north Bremen brief for 2026-10-03 with comms
   drafts enabled, checking realtime, BSAG/VBN notices, and any
   corridor-matched Bremen.de or VMZ impacts for the Tag der Deutschen Einheit
   weekend.

   ```json
   {
     "date": "2026-10-03",
     "corridors": ["central", "north"],
     "include_comms_draft": true
   }
   ```

### `draft_passenger_information`

This tool does not fetch sources itself. Provide an `issue_summary` by copying
or paraphrasing the relevant details from VBN notices, BSAG news, or any other
public source, and the tool will produce ready-to-publish passenger copy in the
requested format and channel.

> **Note:** In the current read-only server configuration, this tool operates
> as a drafting aid — output must be reviewed and published manually. Its full
> potential is realised in a write-enabled MCP workflow: paired with human-in-the-loop
> approval step, it can drive an end-to-end
> communications pipeline from incident detection through to passenger
> notification, with a human reviewing and approving each draft before it goes
> live.

1. Prompt: Draft an app update for line 2 passengers: VBN says line 2 is
   diverted from 8 to 29 June 2026 because of track work; Lloydstraße and
   Doventor are not served and Doventorsteinweg is served instead.

   ```json
   {
     "line_ids": ["2"],
     "issue_summary": "From 8 June 2026, 03:00, to 29 June 2026, 03:00, line 2 is diverted between Hansator and Radio Bremen via Haferkamp (platform A) and Doventorsteinweg because of track work. Lloydstraße and Doventor are not served; Doventorsteinweg is additionally served.",
     "channel": "app"
   }
   ```

2. Prompt: Draft web copy for lines 21, 23, 31, and N3: VBN lists Achterstraße
   works from 13 April to December 2026, with line 31 split and stops including
   Universität-Nord not served.

   ```json
   {
     "line_ids": ["21", "23", "31", "N3"],
     "issue_summary": "Because of construction work in Achterstraße from 13 April 2026 until expected December 2026, lines 21, 23, 31, and N3 are diverted. Line 31 is split; stops including Helmer, Berufsbildungswerk, Lise-Meitner-Straße, Universität/Zentralbereich, Universität-Nord, and Linzer Straße are not served on affected trips.",
     "channel": "web"
   }
   ```

3. Prompt: Draft a stop-display note for line 20: VBN lists Kanal- und
   Straßenbauarbeiten in Steffensweg from 12 August 2024 to expected mid-2026,
   with a Nordstraße diversion and several stops not served.

   ```json
   {
     "line_ids": ["20"],
     "issue_summary": "Because of sewer and road construction in Steffensweg from 12 August 2024 until expected mid-2026, line 20 is diverted in both directions between Lange Reihe and Konsul-Smidt-Straße via Nordstraße. Bremervörder Straße, Karl-Peters-Straße, Sankt-Magnus-Straße, and Johann-Bornemacher-Straße are not served.",
     "channel": "stop"
   }
   ```

## Partial-result semantics

All public sources are unstable. The server does not hide that instability:

- `status: "complete"` means no source warnings were attached
- `status: "partial"` means at least one warning was attached
- `sources` reports freshness and staleness by source
- `warnings` reports machine-readable source problems such as timeouts, stale-cache fallback, parser drift, or truncated results
- `citations` reports source-level attribution for the returned `data`

Each tool response also includes a readable `Citations` section in its text
output. In `structuredContent`, citations use this shape:

```ts
interface Citation {
  id: string; // cite-1, cite-2, stable within one response
  source: string;
  title: string;
  source_url: string;
  alternate_urls?: string[];
  fetched_at?: string;
  published_at?: string;
  content_hash?: string;
  claim_paths: string[]; // JSON Pointer paths such as /data/0
}
```

Citation granularity is source-level. Service notices, external impacts, and
shift-brief major events cite exact record URLs when those URLs are already
present in provenance. Aggregate outputs such as line health and derived shift
brief sections cite the configured public source catalog.

## Risk and attribution limitations

- corridor matching is alias-based, not geographic
- risk scoring is explainable but heuristic
- citations identify source material, not claim-level evidence spans
- realtime coverage depends on public GTFS-Realtime availability
- notices and events rely on HTML structure that may change without notice

Official public sources used by this server:

- VBN GTFS-Realtime and notice pages
- BSAG Aktuelles / operational notices
- VMZ Bremen RSS and roadworks pages
- Bremen event listings

## Live smoke checks

The live suite is opt-in and never runs in normal CI:

```bash
npm run test:live
```

It fetches the configured official source URLs and only asserts transport/parser invariants. It prints per-source status without logging response bodies.

## Troubleshooting parser warnings

Common warning patterns:

- `SOURCE_REFRESH_FAILED`: the source did not refresh and stale cache may be in use
- `PARSER_NO_RECORDS`: the page structure changed or no operational records matched
- `MISSING_EFFECTIVE_DATE`: the source content omitted a usable date window
- `PDF_EXTRACT_FAILED`: VMZ PDF content could not be extracted

If warnings persist, verify the live source HTML or feed structure before changing the parser.
